# A filament spooler to be used in conjuction with [Tuggbo](https://github.com/CorneileM/Tuggbo)

The spooler uses a DC motor that generates a pesudo-clutch effect by attaching a MOSFET motor controller to the DC engine and cycling the motor off very briefly (ChokeTime) in between longer intervals of driving the motor. The ChokeTime and motor speed can be adjusted until the spooler pulls filament from Tuggbo with the right amount of tension (i.e, keeps the filament tight and spooling neatly, without pulling so hard that the Tuggbo falls over.

I still need to add STLs for the spooler parts to allow 3D-printing of spooler parts.
